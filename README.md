# H7 Oma moduli

I figured it would be best to do something useful for the projectÂ so I decided to try out something I might need in the future: 
Installing & Configuring Squid Proxy Cache Server with Salt.

Squid Proxy Server is a server application that stands between the Internet and the webserver providing reverse proxy services and caching options for websites. For this project I wanted to use Squid Proxy to control Internet access for specific sites and also try out some different configurations out of interest. 

Baby steps of first installation:

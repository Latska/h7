# H7 Oma moduli

I figured it would be best to do something useful for the projectÂ so I decided to try out something I might need in the future: 
Installing & Configuring Squid Proxy Cache Server with Salt.

Squid Proxy Server is a server application that stands between the Internet and the webserver providing reverse proxy services and caching options for websites. For this project I wanted to use Squid Proxy to control Internet access for specific sites and also try out some different configurations out of interest. 

Baby steps of first installation:

* Creator: Lauri Immonen
* State as of now: Alpha
* Link: https://github.com/Latska/h7


I began the project by instaling Squid Proxy manually:

lauri@latska:~$ sudo apt install -y squid
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done

Moving to the /squid/ directory and checking out what's up:

lauri@latska:~$ cd /etc/squid/
lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ ls
conf.d  errorpage.css  squid.conf


The squid.conf configuration file had about ~8600 lines and I decided it would be best to remove the comments out of it, but to be safe lets take a backup of the .conf at first:

lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ sudo cp squid.conf squidbackup.conf

lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ ls
conf.d  errorpage.css  squidbackup.conf  squid.conf

And remove them comments out by using grep:

lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ sudo grep -o '^[^#]*' squid.conf
acl localnet src 0.0.0.1-0.255.255.255	
acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8		
acl localnet src 100.64.0.0/10		
acl localnet src 169.254.0.0/16 	
acl localnet src 172.16.0.0/12		
acl localnet src 192.168.0.0/16		
acl localnet src fc00::/7       	
acl localnet src fe80::/10      	
acl SSL_ports port 443
acl Safe_ports port 80		
acl Safe_ports port 21		
acl Safe_ports port 443		
acl Safe_ports port 70		
acl Safe_ports port 210		
acl Safe_ports port 1025-65535	
acl Safe_ports port 280		
acl Safe_ports port 488		
acl Safe_ports port 591		
acl Safe_ports port 777		
acl CONNECT method CONNECT
http_access deny !Safe_ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports
http_access allow localhost manager
http_access deny manager
include /etc/squid/conf.d/*
http_access allow localhost
http_access deny all
http_port 3128
coredump_dir /var/spool/squid
refresh_pattern ^ftp:		1440	20%	10080
refresh_pattern ^gopher:	1440	0%	1440
refresh_pattern -i (/cgi-bin/|\?) 0	0%	0
refresh_pattern .		0	20%	4320


Now that the configuration file is all cleaned up, it's time to create the /salt/squid/ destination and copy the cleaned up .conf file there:

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ cd /etc/squid/
lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ cd
lauri@latska:~$ cd /etc/squid/
lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ sudo mkdir /srv/salt/squid
lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ sudo cp squid.conf /srv/salt/squid/
lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ cd /srv/salt/squid
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ ls
squid.conf

First I made the init.sls -file and made it path from the /salt/squid directory to /etc/squid/. I also modified the squid.conf file to change its default port from 3128 to 8080:

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ sudoedit init.sls
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ cat init.sls
squid:
  pkg.installed

/etc/squid/squid.conf:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://squid/squid.conf
 
 
And to test it out by running salt state.apply command:

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ sudo salt '*' state.apply squid
orjatar:
----------
          ID: squid
    Function: pkg.installed

Total states run:     2
Total run time: 231.665 ms


And also enable port 8080 on ufw:


lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
Rules updated
Rules updated (v6)

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid2$ sudo netstat -plnd
tcp6       0      0 :::8080                 :::*                    LISTEN      44779/(squid-1)     


There are a lot of different tricks you can do with the Squid Proxy. First I wanted to try if it actually worked by restrict the access to certain websites.
I made a new directory /sites/ and added a restricted_sites file with ".google.com" in there.

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ sudo mkdir sites
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ cd sites/
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid/sites$ sudoedit restricted_sites
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid/sites$ cat restricted_sites 
http:google.com

Add the following to the the squid.conf file: 
The first line is path to the .txt files with allowed IP-addresses.
The second line is the path for the URLS that will be restricted from our IP-addresses
The third line is is the actual rule for the config file.

acl allowed_ips src "/etc/squid/allowed_ips.txt"  
acl restrictedsites dstdomain "/etc/squid/restricted_sites"
http_access deny restricted_sites 


And also added the following to the init.sls -file:

/etc/squid/restricted_sites:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://squid/sites/restricted_sites
    
/etc/squid/allowed_ips.txt:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://squid2/allowed_ips.txt
   
 
    
    
And to try out the changes by salt state.apply command:

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ sudo salt '*' state.apply squid
orjatar:
changes:  
Summary for orjatar
------------
Succeeded: 4 (changed=3)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     4
Total run time: 219.061 ms

The Salt states seemed to be working, but now for testing the actual proxy settings if it's working by using the 'curl' command and also with Fire fox:

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid2$ curl www.google.com

And to test out that other sites are available:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103587811/168886733-19c2924f-d0bc-4175-9dfc-2d11da15ee02.png)


Looks like it's working as planned. Next up I wanted to try blocking sites by simply using words such as 'google', 'yle' or 'fi' instead of actual URLs:
First I made new file 'blocked_sites' in /squid/sites with those blockable words.

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ cd sites/
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid/sites$ sudoedit blocked_sites
[sudo] password for lauri: 
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid/sites$ cat blocked_sites 
google
yle
fi


Then added the following lines to the squid.conf -file:

acl blocked_sites url_regex -i "/etc/squid/blocked_sites" 
http_access deny blocked_sites 


Added the following to the init.sls file:

/etc/squid/blocked_sites:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://squid/sites/blocked_sites

Applied the changes with state.apply -command and restarted Squid:


lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ sudo salt '*' state.apply squid
Summary for orjatar
------------
Succeeded: 5 (changed=2)
Failed:    0
------------
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid$ sudo systemctl restart squid


And to test out if the new proxy settings are working: Looks like https://yle.fi is no longer working:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103587811/168889785-cf7ca694-7e75-47b9-b52d-2df2860a73fe.png)


As well as iltalehti.fi (as we set 'fi' in the banned_sites list), but wikipedia.org is working as it should:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103587811/168890421-50f4cd22-a4fa-4f41-884e-ce7444614a2a.png)


The last test was only allow access to a certain sites from our network:

Made a new file with the allowed sites (and also removed the 'fi' from banned words list:

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid2$ cd sites/
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid2/sites$ sudo micro allowed_sites
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid2/sites$ cat allowed_sites 
.terokarvinen.com
.haaga-helia.fi

auri@latska:/srv/salt/squid2/sites$ sudo micro blocked_sites 
lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid2/sites$ cat blocked_sites 
google
yle


Added the following to the squid.conf file, meaning that everything else should be blocked but those sites we just determined:

acl allowed_sites dstdomain "/etc/squid/allowed_sites"
http_access allow allowed_ips allowed_sites


And the following to the init.sls -file:

/etc/squid/allowed_sites:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://squid2/sites/allowed_sites


And try out the changes with salt state.apply command and restart the Squid.service:

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid2$ sudo salt '*' state.apply squid2
orjatar:
Summary for orjatar
------------
Succeeded: 6 (changed=3)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     6

lauri@latska:/srv/salt/squid2$ sudo systemctl restart squid


And to test out the newest proxy settings. Looks like we can access haaga-helia.fi & terokarvinen.com, which were the only ones we allowed:

And to test out any other website, unable to connect:

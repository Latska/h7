# H7 Oma moduli

I figured it would be best to do something useful for the projectÂ so I decided to try out something I might need in the future: 
Installing & Configuring Squid Proxy Cache Server with Salt.

Squid Proxy Server is a server application that stands between the Internet and the webserver providing reverse proxy services and caching options for websites. For this project I wanted to use Squid Proxy to control Internet access for specific sites and also try out some different configurations out of interest. 

Baby steps of first installation:

* Creator: Lauri Immonen
* State as of now: Alpha

I began the project by instaling Squid Proxy manually:

lauri@latska:~$ sudo apt install -y squid
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done

Moving to the /squid/ directory and checking out what's up:

lauri@latska:~$ cd /etc/squid/
lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ ls
conf.d  errorpage.css  squid.conf


The squid.conf configuration file had about ~8600 lines and I decided it would be best to remove the comments out of it, but to be safe lets take a backup of the .conf at first:

lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ sudo cp squid.conf squidbackup.conf

lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ ls
conf.d  errorpage.css  squidbackup.conf  squid.conf

And remove them comments out by using grep:

lauri@latska:/etc/squid$ sudo grep -o '^[^#]*' squid.conf
